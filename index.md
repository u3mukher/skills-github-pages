title: Hi, I’m Ushnik Mukherjee, a football enthusiast with a passion for data. Combining my love for the beautiful game with a scientific approach, I aim to uncover the hidden stories behind the numbers. 

Screaming at the TV wasn’t cutting it, so I started ‘Expected Stats’. Because in modern football, if it’s not ‘expected,’ is it even real?

Growing up, I was always fascinated by the art of anticipation—trying to predict what a player would do in a given moment, the decisions they’d make, and how those choices shaped the game.

This blog is my way of diving deeper into those moments—analyzing how teams and players make decisions, measuring their effectiveness, and sharing what the data reveals.

Join me as I crunch numbers, analyze the game, and keep you curious.
