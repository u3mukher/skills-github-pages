# About

Hi, welcome to x-stats!

My name is Ushnik Mukherjee, and I'm a football enthusiast with a passion for data. Screaming at the TV wasn’t cutting it anymore, so I started Expected Stats—because in modern football, if it’s not “expected,” is it even real?

Growing up, I was always fascinated by the art of anticipation—predicting what a player would do in a given moment, the decisions they’d make, and how those choices shape the game. This blog is my way of diving deeper into those moments—analyzing how teams and players make decisions, measuring their effectiveness, and sharing what the data reveals.

Join me as I crunch numbers, analyze the game, and keep you curious. Let’s explore the fascinating intersection of football and data together!
